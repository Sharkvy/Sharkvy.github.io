## About This Project

This project is an interactive space animation designed to visually explain the differences between key web development concepts: **frontend (client)**, **backend (server)**, and **API**. Each planet in the animation represents a different part of a typical web application architecture, helping users understand how the client, server, and API interact with each other.
