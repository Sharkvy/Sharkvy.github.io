🚀 About This Project

This small yet stellar project was built with React and Vite as part of an assignment to explore key web development concepts:
✨ Frontend (Client), 🔧 Backend (Server), and 🌐 API.

Imagine a cosmic playground where planets represent each major component of a typical web application. Through a simple interactive space animation, you'll see how the client, server, and API orbit around each other—communicating and working together to bring a web app to life.
💡 Why This Project?

Understanding how web apps work under the hood can feel abstract. This project turns those invisible interactions into a visual experience, making it easier (and more fun!) to grasp how each part of a full-stack application fits together.
